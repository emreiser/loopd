Loopd

Loopd is a clean, intuitive RSS feed aggregator that allows the user to focus on the content without all of the clutter.

Loopd uses the Feedzirra gem to fetch and parse RSS feeds. Users can easily create categories to sort their feeds into, filter by category and feed, all while viewing them in our sleek design. If a feed provides the full content of its article we allow the user to read those articles in-app.
